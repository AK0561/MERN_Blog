      `Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime that allows you to build robust, scalable server-side applications. In this article, we will walk you through the process of building your own Node.js server. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this step-by-step guide will help you get started.`,
      `1.Before you can start building a Node.js server, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/) to download and install the latest version. Once installed, you'll have access to the Node Package Manager (npm), which is essential for managing packages and dependencies.`,
      `2.Create a new directory for your Node.js project and navigate to it using your terminal. Run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. This command will prompt you to provide some information about your project and create a package.json file, which will track your project's dependencies and configuration.`,
      `3.Now, let's install the packages you'll need for building your server. The most common choice for creating a web server in Node.js is Express.js. Run npm install express --save to install the Express framework and add it as a dependency in your package.json file. You can also install other packages as per your project requirements.`,
      `4.Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., server.js) in your project directory. In this file, you'll start building your server. Import the necessary modules and create an instance of the Express application. Define routes, middleware, and specify how your server should respond to HTTP requests.`,
      `5.To start your Node.js server, run node server.js in the terminal. Your server should now be running, and you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.`,
